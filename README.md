git is like a bank

the repository is like the account

git init would be like opening an account

git status would be like checking your balance

the staging area is like the holding time before the transaction clears with the bank/tests the bank does to make sure the transaction is legit.

git commit it's the same as swiping your card or depositing money/somehow modifying the balance

the messages that go with the commit would be like the memos you make while purchasing OR names of places you're transacting with/transaction info

git log would be like the activity on your monthly statements

git checkout would be like you changing your mind about the transaction before money changes hands or the bank rejecting the transaction before money actually transfers

<!-- gitHub would be like the central bank (federal reserve) -->

hub create to new branches would be like adding a new checkings/savings account with the bank

git rm is like a return you make, as if you decided you didn't want to buy an item after all
